# Census-Data-Analysis
Takes the Census data and plots the relationship between 2013 population size and education (percentage of people with a bachelor’s degree) for the counties in each state to see if that relationship doesn’t hold in some states but does in others.
Uses the data ( ) command to review the data sets available in the installed packages that can be combined in some useful way with R and generates a chart showing some aspect of that combination.
